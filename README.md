# obstacle-avoiding-robot
An aurdino based robot that detects objects using sensors

## Abstract
      An aurdino based moving robot with ultrasonic sensor,servo motor,motor driver.This robot detects the obstacles arriving at the front and diverts itself to an another side 
      
## Application
      This mini project can frame a little part in real time application such as automated driver cars.
